{"NAME":"Bobo","WEBSITE":"http://bobo.digicool.com/","DESCRIPTION":"Bobo is a light-weight framework for creating WSGI web applications. It's goal is to be easy to use and remember. It addresses 2 problems: 1) mapping URLs to objects and 2) calling objects to generate HTTP responses. Bobo doesn't have a templating language, a database integration layer, or a number of other features that are better provided by WSGI middle-ware or application-specific libraries. Bobo builds on other frameworks, most notably WSGI and WebOb."}
