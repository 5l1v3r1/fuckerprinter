{"NAME":"CoDeSys-Web-Visualization","DESCRIPTION":"CoDeSys can create XML descriptions of the visualization objects and download them to the PLC. There a Web-Server will provide the PLC data in XML format too and thus can create a continuously updated visualization which can be opened in the Web Browser of any computer which is connected via Internet, independently from the target platform (e.g. useful for remote maintenance purposes).","WEBSITE":"http://www.3s-software.com/index.shtml?en_CoDeSys_WebVisu"}
