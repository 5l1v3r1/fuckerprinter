{"DESCRIPTION":"The warning header contains additional information about the status of a response that might not be reflected by the response status code. According to RFC2616 section 14.46, if a cache returns a stale response, either because of a max-stale directive on a request, or because the cache is configured to override the expiration time of a response, the cache MUST attach a Warning header to the stale response, using Warning 110 (Response is stale).","WEBSITE":"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.46","NAME":"Warning"}
