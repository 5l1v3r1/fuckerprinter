{"NAME":"Varnish","WEBSITE":"http://www.varnish-cache.org/","DESCRIPTION":"Varnish is an HTTP accelerator written in C designed for content-heavy dynamic web sites. In contrast to other HTTP accelerators, such as Squid, which began life as a client-side cache, or Apache, which is primarily an origin server, Varnish was designed from the ground up as an HTTP accelerator."}
