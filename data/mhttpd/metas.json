{"WEBSITE":"","DESCRIPTION":"MHTTPD stands for Minimal Hypertext Transport Protocol Daemon. MHTTPD is fast, simple and very small. It supports HTTP GET and POST method (that's all you need for more than 90% of time). It also supports HTTP Basic Authentication. Authentication can be performed by name and password lookup in a text file (userid:Unix_crypted_password) or from A LDAP server directly. And the server can be compiled as a secure server (SSL). The server does not have any configuration file and will not have any. Everything needed is hard coded at the top of the single C file.","NAME":"MHttpd"}
