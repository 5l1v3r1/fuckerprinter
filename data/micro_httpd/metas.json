{"NAME":"micro_httpd","WEBSITE":"http://www.acme.com/software/micro_httpd/","DESCRIPTION":"micro_httpd is a very small Unix-based HTTP server. It runs from inetd, which means its performance is poor. But for low-traffic sites, it's quite adequate. It implements all the basic features of an HTTP server."}
